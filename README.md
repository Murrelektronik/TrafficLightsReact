# Traffic Lights Demo Project

The Traffic Lights Demo project is a small simulation of a traffic light system implemented using Node.js, React, Vite, and Material-UI. It showcases the functionality of a basic traffic light control system, including the transition between red, yellow, and green lights according to predefined timing intervals.

This project serves as a simple demonstration of how traffic lights function in a web environment and can be useful for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex traffic management simulations. It provides a visual representation of traffic light behavior using React components styled with Material-UI, allowing for easy customization and extension to suit different scenarios or experiments related to traffic flow control on the web platform.
